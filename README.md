# METAR

This is a simple regular expression based METAR parser which I use in a couple of my projects.

I'm an avid aviation enthusiast so this was a hobby project which did a few years ago, it's only occurred to me now to upload and share it with the world of coders/aviation enthusiasts.

It goes without saying that there are probably bugs, I think it's fair to say that usage of this in operational situations is very much at your own risk, especially regarding the flight rules (VFR, IFR, etc.). I would always encourage using a sanctioned weather provider when doing any real flight planning.

As for API stability, I may add, change, or remove fields in the future, but I'll observe the semantic versioning system to ensure minimum disruption to anyone who wants to use this.

At any rate, if you use Swift Package Manager to use this code, perhaps you should consider pinning the precise version to avoid upsets.

Thank you.
